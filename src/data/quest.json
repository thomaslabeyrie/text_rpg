Lanterns flicker weakly in wrought-iron sconces, casting long, dancing shadows across the narrow alleys that snake away from the town square. The scent of damp earth and burning tallow fills the air.<br/><br/>You step into the square as the last light bleeds from the sky. A hunched figure closes the shutters of the inn to your left, while the distant clang of metal echoes from the blacksmith’s forge. A stray dog slinks between crates near the boarded-up shopfronts, and above it all, the bell tower looms — silent.<br/><br/>Something feels… off. The town is too quiet for this hour. No chatter. No laughter. Just the uneasy hush of a place holding its breath.",
